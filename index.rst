Rubin Observatory Auxilliary Telescope Calibration Illumination System Handbook

Overview
================
The Auxilliary Telescope (AuxTel) Calibration Illumination System will be used to illuminate the white calibration screen in the Auxilliary Telescope with several wavelengths of light. The illumination can be tuned from 350-1200 nm. The Illumination System will sit on the dome floor directly below the calibration screen. 

The system was developed and built in Tucson. This document is meant to give an overview of the system and document the process of assembling the system when it is shipped to Chile. It also includes an overview of how the system should be operated with sample code. This document also includes links to all documentation related to this system so it can be more readily accessed. 

The work to prepare this susbystem for shipment was tracked in the JIRA Epic `SITCOM-259c <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/SITCOM-259>`__

Elements
==============
There are five main functional elements of the AuxTel Illumination System. The White Light Source supplies the light, the Monochromator changes the color, the optics deliver the light to the calibration screen, and the Electrometer and Fiber Spectrograph are used to monitor the output beam. Here, we describe these main elements as well as the structure that supports them. 

White Light Source system
-------------------------
The white light source is a KiloArc Lamp built by Optical Building Blocks. It can output white light with a power of 800 - 1200 W. This light is directed into the monochromator.

Because of the heat generated by such a lamp, before sending the light into the monochromator, the light travels through a water source which absorbs much of the infrared wavelengths. This water heats up, so the white light source must be operated with a chiller, discussed below. The chiller should keep the water cool enough, but if there is ever a situation where there is too much heat being sent into the monochromator, there is a thermal fuse glued to the entrance to the monochromator. When it hits a certain temperature it will trigger the emergency stop. On the mountain, there are also temperatures that will freeze the water in the cell. In the event of this occurance, there are heaters that are attached to the cell which will be turned on at a certain temperature. These are controlled by an external controller (get info on heater controller). 

The white light source can either be manually controlled or remotely controlled. It is important to toggle which mode you are using on the back of the white light source. We use a LabJack to send remote messages to the WLS as voltage levels. See (TBD) for more information on that.

There are fans internal to the WLS which blow air out of a hole at the top. Secured to this hole is an aluminum duct that pushes the air outside of the enclosed area.

There are two cables that come from the WLS: one for commanding the power level and the other to receive status and error messages. 

Documentation on the White Light Source can be found on Docushare `here <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-5178>`__

Chiller
---------
The chiller is used to cool the water cell in the white light source. This uses a mixture of ethanol and water (50/50)?? to carry heat from a shell surrounding the main water cell. The ethanol helps the water in these tubes from freezing. It does not actually pump the water in and out of the cell. The temperature should be set to XX and the control is on the water coming back to the chiller so there is likely to be some delay in large temperature swings. 

The chiller is connected to a Moxa RS-232 to ethernet serial converter and then commanded via CSC. It must run at 9600 baud.

Monochromator
-------------
The monochromator is essentially a spectrometer. With the incoming white light, it can output any wavelength from 0 - 1200 nm with fairly high resolution, however we limit the wavelength range to 350 - 1200 nm. The monochromator is the Horiba iHR 320 Fully Automated Imaging Spectrometer. There are two 1200 gr/mm gratings: centered at 400 nm (blue) and one at 750 nm (red). These gratings both have a spectral dispersion of $\sim$2.31 nm/mm. There are two slits, both of which can be adjusted from 0-5mm, but not including 5mm.  The ``Entry" slit is where the light from the white light source enters the monochromator and the "Exit" is where the light exits the monochromator as a ``single" wavelength. It also includes a mirror. The monochromator uses very little power at 12V to change the slit width, the wavelength, and the grating. 

The software for the monochromator is run on a Windows Machine, mounted on an Embedded Systems minicontroller. It is connected via USB to this windows machine. When first starting up, the windows machine must be accessed via Remote Desktop for the initialization process. Once that has completed, the CSC can be used to control the Monochromator.

The monochromator is secured with it's three feet mounted to the table.

Fiber Spectrograph System
-------------------------
and fiber illuminator

Electrometer
------------
The electrometer used is the Keithley 6517B. It reads the current from a Hammatsu Si S2281 Series photodiode. The photodiode samples the light on the edge of the optical path. It does not measure the total brightness but rather any changes in irradiance from day to day and even throughout a daily operation. 

The electrometer is controlled via a Serial Device Server, the MOXA .... 

Information on the electrometer and photodiode can be found on Docushare `here <https://docushare.lsst.org/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-5176>`__

Optics
------
Three major optical elements. 

Shutter system
--------------
In order to both keep light enclosed when not needed and also to keep dust out of the illumination system, there is a shutter for the output of the beam. The beam travels through glass when the shutter is opened. The shutter can only be commanded fully open or fully closed, not at a point in between. When the shutter has reached one limit or another, it will hit a switch which will confirm to software that it has indeed reached the end of travel. The linear actuator is attached to the top of the structure so must be disassembled before the top of the box can be moved. 

Structure
---------
The white light source and monochromator sit on a table surrounded with black cardboard used to create a fully black environment inside. There are thru-holes on the table for the cables that run to the electronics cabinet which is secured below the table. The chiller is also secured below the table. Surrounding the bottom of the table is a black curtain. 

The linear actuator that drives the shutter sits on the top of the structure and must be disconnected before the top is removed.
